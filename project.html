    <h1>Project Title</h1>
   
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        A web service that allows users to track their medication use and corelate it with their mood. It would take the form of a web based cross 
        platform app utilising a framework such as React Native. This app would be capable of acting as a medication reminder app as well as allowing 
        the user to describe their mood in the time between doses. As well as a detailed written description the user could input their mood on a 
        multi-point scale of user defined length. Using this data, the app will provide a visualisation of mood reports compared to medication taking. 
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        Both I and people I know have been taking medications either for their entire life or on and off throughout their life and a common 
        question doctors ask during consultations is how those drugs have impacted on their mood, and I can never recall in the moment. While 
        there are apps for both medication tracking and mood tracking, they offer no straightforward way to compare data between the two (Understandably, 
        as the apps are separate and generally made by different developers). This data could then be shown to doctors to more usefully and more 
        accurately describe any potential mood fluctuations while on medication. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The app will run on multiple platforms, ideally it will run on both major mobile platforms, iOS/iPadOS and Android, with the help of React Native as well 
        as Windows and macOS via React Native for Windows + macOS. Later this could be expanded to a generic web platform using regular React, though this would 
        require a significant infrastructure addition in the form of a webserver for hosting the site, and secure storage of user login information.  
        <br><br>
        Users will be able to enter the details of their medication, the dosage they take and the schedule on which to take it. Users would also then 
        be able to enter when they’d like to be asked about their mood be it hourly, daily, bi-daily, weekly, fortnightly or only on specific days. The 
        app will then notify the user, when appropriate, for them to take their medication or log their mood using their operating systems native notification 
        system (for Windows and macOS I believe this will require the application to remain running in the background at all times, potentially at the 
        expense of the user's battery. Mobile platforms shouldn’t have this issue as they provide more robust notification systems) 
        <br><br>
        When the user wants to view the data, perhaps to show to a doctor or to satisfy their own curiosity, they can open a menu in the app where they will 
        be presented with a graph that looks something like this:

        <img src=images/graph.png alt="Example Graph">
        <br>
        From this example graph a doctor could glean that after the initial dose, mood was notably improved, but this effect was short-lived, after the 
        second dose mood declined over the next week. This data can be used to inform the doctor to change the strength of their patient’s medication. 
        <br><br>
        If a user wants to edit their inputted mood or to correct a mistake in the dosage of one of their medications, these can be modified by selecting 
        the entry in the main section of the app. 
        <br><br>
        The app will not support syncing data between multiple installs of the app as this runs into the infrastructure problem mentioned above. It will 
        however allow for the data to be backed up and imported to allow for the user switching platforms or resetting their device as well as keeping a 
        general backup of their sensitive data should they lose their device. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Tools and Technology</h2>
    <p>
        The app will primarily be developed with web technologies, turned into a multi-platform app via React Native (<a href="https://reactnative.dev/">https://reactnative.dev/</a>) and React Native 
        for Windows + macOS (<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/">https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/</a>). A text editor or Javascript integrated development environment (IDE) to 
        write the actual code of the app in Javascript. No other custom software should be needed to be developed outside of the core app. A device running 
        Apple’s macOS will be required to build the app to run on iOS/iPadOS, this can be most easily achieved by using/purchasing an Apple Mac computer 
        though macOS can be run on other hardware using unofficial methods. Android Studio will be required to build for Android devices, this is freely 
        available <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">here</a> 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Skills Required</h2>
    <p>
        The primary skill required is the ability to use the React Native platform and the associated web technologies, primarily Javascript. Facebook, 
        the creators of React, have provided in depth documentation on the React Native platform as well as a basics guide. For further tutorials many 
        paid and free resources are available online from sites such as <a href="https://www.edx.org">EdX</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a> 
        and <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com">TutorialsPoint</a>, among others. No special hardware is required to be created for this project. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>
        When this app is created and made available to others, I hope that others will use it to track their mood as it compares to their 
        medication intake. I hope the app will be used so that doctors can provide more accurate care for their patients by allowing them a 
        greater understanding of the changes a patient's mood may take while taking medication.
