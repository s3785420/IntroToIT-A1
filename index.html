    <h2>Background Information:</h2>
    <p>
        I am from here in Victoria and I completed my VCE at McClelland Secondary College in Frankston, in Melbourne’s south-eastern suburbs. While there I studied 
        Software Development and IT, Further Maths, Philosophy, English and Legal Studies. I also learned some Japanese early in high school and I tried again 
        recently using Duolingo, though I don’t remember much anymore. I recently built my own storage and home media server (in reality it's essentially an office 
        computer with a large 6TB hard drive installed), it runs an Intel i3-9100 with 4gb of ram and a 256GB SSD boot + caching drive. My server runs the Plex 
        Media Server software on Ubuntu Server, allowing me to essentially make my own private Netflix like service with only the tv and movies that I want to 
        watch, as well as acting as a bulk file storage device.
